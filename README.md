# Well hello there!
I'm finally updating the read-me file for this project!


Long story short this is just a little bot project I'm working on that runs my trading Discord server.


As you can also already tell, I've managed to push the obfuscation update. The code has been triple encrypted using 3 different keys that are all large strings (goodluck reverse-engineering or stealing my code LOL).


That's about all I have to say, I hope you enjoy the progress that follows with this bot! :D
