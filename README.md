# Well hello there!
If you found this and the code isn't obfuscated, fuck you.
I'm obfuscating this code with 3 different hand-made encryption methods alongside 3 key methods (uncrackable gg).

Anyways, this is just the github repo for my Discord bot **AZURE-BOT**!
I have this repo so I can host the bot online so it can run 24/7, instead of locally where it can only run if my computer is on.
Hope you enjoy a sneak-peek through the code while you're at it... just no copying, thanks :)
